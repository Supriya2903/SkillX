- **React.js**
- **MongoDB & Mongoose**
- **TailwindCSS**
- **Modern Auth System (Signup/Login)**

## 🚀 What It Does

> Think of it as “Dev-for-Dev Duolingo meets StackOverflow” — but human.

SkillSwap enables:
- 📚 Students to **learn skills** from other students
- 🔁 A give-and-take system: Teach what you're good at, and learn what you need
- 🧑‍💻 1-on-1 skill mentorship and knowledge exchange
- 📝 Post what you can teach or need to learn — and get matched!
- 🔐 Secure signup/login powered by MongoDB

## 🎯 Why This Project

> “Everyone has something to teach and something to learn.”

This solves the common issue where:
- Students don’t know **where to begin**
- Paid courses are expensive and impersonal
- Forums like StackOverflow are too fragmented

SkillSwap gives a community-driven, low-pressure way for peers to learn **real, relevant** skills from each other.
